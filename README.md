## What is the Crypto Volatility Index (CVI) ?

[CVI](https://cvi.finance/) is a crypto volatility index, a decentralized version of VIX (known as the “Market Fear Index”) for the crypto market, predicting volatility in BTC and ETH for the upcoming 30 days.

The CVI is both an index and a trading platform, allowing users to hedge themselves against market volatility or lack thereof.

Since the release of the CVI index, we have shared several updates of real-world market forces that demonstrate the effectiveness of the index itself as a trading tool for crypto traders. This market analysis covered recent [BTC movements](https://medium.com/cvix/latest-btc-trends-as-reflected-in-the-cvx-index-643ef57940c4), including the [highest ever BTC price level](https://cvxofficial.medium.com/record-btc-price-levels-as-reflected-in-the-cvx-index-7e65e9fa0298), the [OKEX scandal](https://medium.com/cvix/okex-scandal-as-reflected-in-the-cvix-index-cdcd405e0ad4), the [US elections](https://cvxofficial.medium.com/us-elections-fear-and-uncertainty-as-reflected-in-the-cvx-index-d6738fa3386e), and [several other market factors](https://cvxofficial.medium.com/cvx-has-reach-an-all-time-high-as-the-market-sees-high-volatility-in-btc-price-levels-dedba06279b2).

The CVI platform is governed by the $GOVI token.

CVI includes a decentralized governance component, where holders of the $GOVI token can vote on matters such as the tradable assets, leverage used, deposit amounts, platform fees and more.

By participating in the platform, by either trading on the platform or taking part in the governance of the platform, $GOVI holders will be able to -
- Share platform fees  
- Vote to change the leverage
- Vote to change the fees
- Vote to change D0 (opening position deposit size)
- Vote to change Dmin (liquidation position deposit minimum level)
- Vote on changes to the data source and aggregation protocol
- Vote on trading platform changes and enhancements
